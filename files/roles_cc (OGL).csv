Rocker
If you don't sweat while on center stage, if you feed off the energy of the crowd, and if you have a raw passion that can't be contained; you belong here. Rockers (both Rockerbois and Rockergrrls) aren't your street poets playing guitar for a few eddies or a handout on a sunny day in the park, they aren't social normative identifiers of thought, and they certainly aren't the first thing you think of when 'punk' or 'rebel' crosses your mind. Rockers aren't defined by culture, society, or the counter-movements against them. Rockers are outside of that. The Rockers of 2020, the ones people pay attention to, see the state of things and channel it into an indefinable moment. They aren't the spark that starts the fire but rather the atom bomb that changes history forever.

Some say there's a message in the noise, a purpose behind the music, but whatever the truth is, the Rocker knows how to hone it to a razor sharp edge and stab the listener in the heart with it. Like a necromancer raising the dead, a Rocker drives the common folk to stand up and see the world through a lense of strife, sanguine, and raw determination; a stark reality that would be alien and disturbing if it wasn't for the Rocker shepherding them toward something greater than themselves.

History is filled with Rockers but you already know your favorite. You have a pocket studio, calluses from tempering your chagrin, and a world you know will listen if you just put the right notes in the right place. You can give the timid courage, the weak strength, and the blind vision. All you need to do is kick down opportunity's door and never stop screaming your heart out.

Solo
The hardest lesson to learn was how cheap human life is. But you were forced to swallow that pill. Now the chrome that's replaced the parts of you that didn't survive is worth a dozen mooks. You've learned to bury that soft part of your humanity; it wouldn't last in this line of work anyways.

You're in a constant arms race against others in your line of work. You have started to rely more and more upon that chrome to give you that slim edge - cyber limbs with weapons and armor, bio-chips to boost your reflexes, and a few black market combat stims that push you up to 11 (even if the crash makes you think twice). Not just to get jobs done but because you may end up crossing blades an opposing Solo - and if the hardest lesson has proved anything, it's that you are worth more dead than alive. But so are they.

You don't have anyone close to you anymore. Part because emotional distance is preferable and part because your killing reflexes are so jacked up, you have to restain yourself from going beserk at the drop of pin. You don't recognize the man in the mirror anymore. Something is missing in his gaze. You killed it when you learned that hardest lesson.

Netrunner`At three, your parents bought you an old Apple IV GS with a Radius 241 wall screen, and your life was changed. By fifth grade, you'd already mastered everything the school computer literacy lab could throw at you - you were already using C and META-LINGUA to crack into the district's mainframe and change your grades. When you were thirteen, you shifted enough funds out of unprotected TransAmerican Bank accounts to finance your first neural interface plugs.|     Now, nothing can stop you. With your direct mental link to the computer, you can plunge headfirst into the dizzying data-winds of the Net; the worldwide telecommunications system that joins humanity together. As an electronic wraith, you are the ultimate "hacker", your brain wired into special modems and computer links. You slip into the "hardest" mainframe systems with ease. Your defense and offense programs are arrayed at a touch of your mental fingertips - a quick jolt of Demon or Vampire and the data fortresses fall. EBM. ITT. Sony-Matsushita-Ford. You've tackled them all, buying, trading and selling their deepest secrets at will.|    Sometimes you uncover important things - Corporate treachery or deadly secrets. But that's not why you Netrun. You live for the new program, the next satellite downlink - the next piece of hot data that comes your way. It's only a matter of time, you think - every year, the counter intrustion programs get better, the Artificial Intelligences smarter. Sooner or later, a faster program or programmer's going to catch up; reach out with electronic fingers through your interface plugs, and stop your heart. But time's on your side, and until the ride runs out, you'll be there, barebrained and headfirst in the Net.`CP2020[CP3002]`Interface;Awareness/Notice;Basic Tech;Educ./Gen.Knowledge;System Knowledge;CyberTech;Cyberdeck Design;Composition;Electronics;Programming
Techie`You can't leave anything alone-if it sits near you for more than five minutes, you've disassembled it and made it into something new. You've always got at least two screwdrivers and a wrench in your pockets. Computer down? No problem. Hydrogen burner out in your Metrocar? No problem. Can't get the video to run or your interface plugs feedbacking? No problem.|    You make your living building, fixing and modifying a crucial occupation in a technological world where no one person really knows how half the stuffworks. You can make some good bucks fixing everyday stuff, but for the serious money, you need to tackle the big jobs. Illegal weapons. Illegal or stolen cybertech. Corporate espionage and counter-espionage gear for the big boys' "black operations". Neat little gadgets like thermite bombs and and hunter-killer robots for the occasional "termination."|    If you're any good, you're making a lot of money. And that money goes into new gadgets, hardware and information. You'll buy almost any new thing - because it might have a dozen sides applications you can use. Of course, your black market work isn't just making you friends - it's also racking you up an impressive number of enemies as well; people who've run into your handiwork and resented it. So you'll invest a lot in defense systems and, if really pushed to the wall, call in a few markers on a Solo or two.`CP2020[CP3002]`Jury Rig;Awareness/Notice;Basic Tech;CyberTech;Teaching;Educ./Gen.Knowledge;Electronics;Weaponsmith;Electronic Security;AV Tech
Med-Tech`Your cousin down the street is just like you, but he's a not a Med-Tech. In a world where half of medicine is related to mechanics, it makes sense. You can do a black market surgical technique faster than a Techie can fix a toaster, and the Solos are always running to you to patch up wounds or install new illegal cybernetics. You've got a lot of the same problems as the Techie, but hopefully that new job with Trauma Team will loosen things up. You hope so because business is booming.`CP2020[CP3002]`Medical Tech;Awareness/Notice;Basic Tech;Diagnose Illness;Educ./Gen.Knowledge;Cryotank Operation;Library Search;Pharmaceuticals;Zoology;Human Perception
Media`They're bending the truth out there. And you're going to stop them. Someone has to do it. The Corporations rule the world. They dump toxics, destabilize economies and commit murder with equal impunity. The Government won't stop them - they own the Government. The only thing between the Corporations and world domination is the Media. And that's you.|    You've got a videocam and a press pass-and you're not afraid to use them. You're a national figure, seen nightly on a million TV sets worldwide. You've got fans, contracts and your own Corporation backing you. They can't make you disappear. When you dig down for the dirt and slime the corrupt officials and Corporate lapdogs try to cover up, you can dig deep. The next morning, you can put the details of their crimes all over the screamsheets and vidscreens. Then the Government has to act.|    A week ago, you followed a hot lead and discovered a medical corporation dumping illegal drugs on the Street. This week, you're uncovering a secret Corporate war in South America-a war with jets, bombs, and cybertroops that's killed almost seven thousand innocent people. Each new story you get to the air is one more blow for freedom and justice. Not to mention ratings.|    It isn't easy. They've tried to pressure your Mediacorp dozens of times. You've had stories suppressed-once, Corporate pressure forced them to cancel your news show. Each time, you went to the top, backed by your news director and your crew, and fought to get the story out. Three or four times, they tried to kill you-that's why your backup's a crack Solo bodyguard and you've got one of the top 'Runners in the business digging through the Net to back your stories. You have to be good, or else.|    Your 'Runner's just phoned in with a hot lead. He's found a line on twenty tons of illegal weapons being shifted to a port in Bolivia-possibly nuclear. You grab your gear and flag your backup. You're going to break those bastards.|    This time, for sure.`CP2020[CP3002]`Credibility;Awareness/Notice;Composition;Educ./Gen.Knowledge;Persuasion;Human Perception;Social;Streetwise; Photo & Film;Interview
Cop`    In the old days, they only used to shoot at cops. Now you're lucky if you just take a slug. The Street is mean these days, filled with new drugs, new gangs, and new weapons that make an M-16 look like a kid's toy. If you're on a City Force, you know how bad it is. You're carrying at least four high caliber weapons, most of them full-auto types, wearing a Kevlar vest that'll stop 850 ft/lbs per square inch-and you're still outgunned and outflanked. Half the gangs are cybered up to begin with - super speed, super reflexes, can see in the dark, carry weapons in their arms...The other half are freelance Corporate mercs - gangs hired by the Corps to enforce their policies on the Street. And there you are - a beat cop or detective in an armored squadcar, patrolling this jungle with the heavy predators.|    The Corporate Cops - now that's the life. Heavy weapons, full combat armor, Trauma Teamâ„¢ backup, AV-4 assault vehicles and gyrocopters with miniguns. But they only patrol the sectors of the City that the Government's licensed them for. The nice, clean sectors full of new office buildings and fancy restaurants - where no jacked up psychopunk is going to ever go on a killing spree with an AK-47. You get the bad sections. Burned out buildings and abandoned cars where every night is a new firefight and another great opportunity for a messy death.|    If you're really unlucky, you might draw PsychoSquad detail. PsychoSquad guys get the job of hunting down heavily armed and armored cyborgs who've flipped out. Sure, the PS guys have access to railguns, gyros, and AVs. But a cyberpsycho can walk through machine gun fire and not feel it. A lot of the Psycho Squad detectives are crazy themselves. They load up with boosted reflexes, get some monsterously huge guns, and go hunt the cyborgs solo. But you're not that crazy.||    Yet.`CP2020[CP3002]`Authority;Awareness/Notice;Handgun;Human Perception;Athletics;Educ./Gen.Knowledge;Brawling;Melee;Interrogation;Streetwise
Corporate`In the old days, they would have called you a yuppie - a hard driven, fast-track MBA on his way up the Corporate ladder. Sure, it's selling your soul to the Company, but face it; the Corporations rule the Cyberpunk world. They control governments, markets, nations, armies-you name it. And you know that whoever controls the Corporations controls everything else.|    Right now, your life as a junior executive is anything but easy. There are guys underneath you who'd kill for a shot at your job. There are guys over you who'd kill to keep you out of their jobs. And they're not kidding about the killing every up and comer in the Corporation has his own crew of Solos and Netrunners to cover his pet projects. Sabotage? Constantly. Bribery? Routine. Blackmail? Common. Promotion by assassination? Always a possibilty. The stakes are that high--one slip and you could be out on the Street with the rest of the trash. Or dead.|    And the projects your supervisors give you! Some are pretty straight forward; design a new productivity schedule for the Corporation's medical subsidiary. Some are pretty raw-send a "black operations" team into the City to spread a designer plague so the Marketing team can clean up selling the vaccine. Last week, you led a mixed team of Solos, 'Runners andTechies on a headhunting run to kidnap a researcher from a rival company. The week before, your project was to steal plans for a new suborbital shuttle from the EuroSpace Agency (so that the Aerospace Division could copy the design and sell it to the Soviets).|    You told yourself you joined the Corporation to make it a better place-work from the inside, you said. But nowyou're not so sure. Your ideals are a little tarnished and things are getting pretty bleak. But you can'tworry about ethics now. You've gota report due in an hour, and it looks like that guy in Sales is planning to ice your database for good. You're gonna ice him first.`CP2020[CP3002]`Resources;Awareness/Notice;Human Perception;Educ./Gen.Knowledge;Library Search;Social;Persuasion;Stock Market;Wardrobe & Style;Personal Grooming
Fixer`You realized fast thatyou weren't ever going to get into a Corporate job. And you didn't think you were tough enough or crazy enough to be a Solo either. But as a small time punk, you knew you had a knack for figuring outwhat other people wanted, and howto get it for them. For a price, of course.|    Now your deals have moved past the nickle-and-dime stuff into the big time. Maybe you move illegal weapons over the border. Or steal and resell medical supplies from the Corporations. Perhaps you're a skill brokeracting as an agent for high priced Solos and 'Runners, or even hiring a whole Nomad pack to back a client's contracts. You buy and sell favors like an old-style Mafia godfather. You have connections into all kinds of businesses, deals and political groups. You don't do this directly, of course-no, you use your contacts and allies as part of a vast web of intrigue and coersion. If there's a hot nightclub in the City, you've bought into it. If there are newmilitary-classweapons on the Street, you smuggled 'em in. If there's a Corporate war going down, you're negotiating between sides with an eye on the main chance.|    But you're not entirely in it for the bucks. If someone needs to get the heat off, you'll hide them. You get people housing when there isn't any, and you bring in food when the neighborhoods are blockaded. Maybe you do it because you know they'll owe you later, but you're not sure. You're one part Robin Hood and two parts Al Capone. Back in the 90's, theywould have called you a crimelord. But this is the fragmented, nasty, deadly 2020s. Now they call you a Fixer.`CP2020[CP3002]`Streetdeal;Awareness/Notice;Forgery;Handgun;Brawling;Melee;Pick Lock;Pick Pocket;Intimidate;Persuasion
Nomad`They drove your family off the Farm ten years ago. The Corporations rolled in, took over the land, and put rent-acops all over the place. It wasn't the first time it'd happened; it wouldn't be the last. Gradually, your family fell in with a bunch of other homeless families, and they met another group... until you'd created a Nomad pack of nearly two hundred members.|    Now, crammed into a huge, ragtag fleet of cars, vans, buses and RV's, your Nomad pack roams the freeways. You look for supplies, odd jobs and spare parts in a world where society has fragmented. The pack is your home-it has teachers, Med Techs, leaders, and mechanics-it's virtually a town on wheels in which everyone is related by marriage or kinship. Sometimes the Pack pulls into a town just to fuel up or get grub. Other times, it swings south to follow the harvest; you pick crops in trade for cash or food. Less law abiding Packs are like mobile armies, terrorizing cities and hiring out as muscle in Corporate wars. For obvious reasons, the cops don't like Nomads. But it doesn't matter- your vehicles are usually well armored and bristling with stolen weapons; mini guns, rocket launchers and the like. Every kid knows howto use a rifle, and everyone packs a knife. Being homeless in the 2000's isn't easy.|    The most visible members of the Pack are the Scouts-leather armored riders on bikes or in fast muscle cars, who protect the convoy from attacks and hunt up safe campsites. As a Scout, you're on the lookout for trouble, and you usually can find enough of it, with rival Nomad Packs, the Law, and the Corporates all after you. Like a modern day cowboy, you ride the hard trail. You've got a gun, a bike and that's all you need. You're a Nomad.`CP2020[CP3002]`Family;Awareness/Notice;Edurance;Melee;Rifle;Drive;Basic Tech;Wilderness Survival;Brawling;Athletics
